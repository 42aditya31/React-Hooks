## 🧠 What is `useRef`?

`useRef` is a React hook that gives you a way to **store and persist data** across renders **without causing a re-render** when that data changes.

### 🔑 Key Characteristics:
- Returns a **mutable object**: `{ current: value }`
- Persists data between renders
- Updating `.current` does **not** re-render the component
- Commonly used to:
  - Access DOM elements
  - Store values like timers or previous state
  - Keep mutable values that don’t need to trigger UI updates

### 📦 Analogy:
> Think of `useRef` like a locker 📦: you can store something inside, retrieve or update it anytime, and the locker stays in place — unaffected by outside changes.
