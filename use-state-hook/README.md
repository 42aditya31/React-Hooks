## 🧠 1. What is "State" in React?

- State is a memory system inside a component.
- It stores **changing data** that updates when a user interacts with the app.
- React **re-renders** the UI whenever state changes.

### 🎯 Real-Life Analogy

Think of it like a **cricket scoreboard**:
- The score updates as the game progresses.
- Just like the UI updates as state changes.
